# GoEuro-Task

This project is aimed to accomplish the Task given by GoEuro to automate a
search and assert proper functionality on sort.

Cucumber is used in conjunction with Selenium.

The project can be run with mvn clean install as is. (clean so you don't have cluttered target folder)

Search feature includes @wip tag for the scenarios since they are works in progress.
Scenarios without a @wip tag won't be running in any test, configuration is done on RunCukesTest
